### What is TDEX

TDEX aims to create a global peer to peer network with an open interface for market makers to signal liquidity in different Liquid asset pairs and for traders a faster, non Â­custodial and anonymous way to exchange **Liquid assets**.
To do that, we take advantage of the UTXO model and then the underlying capability of Elements Based networks to perform automated swaps, without the need of a trusted third party.
The system is built on top of TSWAP protocol - a protocol to interact within peers and performs swaps in an automated and pseudo-anonymous fashion. 
We believe in the freedom of speech, of transacting, and humankind empowerment through technology. We want to help build a world which allows individuals to use freedom-enabling technologies, as they see fit, without asking anyone for permission. 

This is the reason why we have been developing TDEX as free open source software.
